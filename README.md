Tidy CXX
==========

Tools for Tidying up C/C++ Code.

This repository contains a collection of tools to tidy up `C`/`C++` source code.
All tools are intended for fixing aesthetic aspects of the code (eg. comment fomatting).

Those rather easy code changes don't require deep understanding of `C++`.
This is why all of them are written in `python3` (rather than based on an actual compiler).

 - Add CLIs eg. for a copyright fixer.
